GriefPrevention
===============

A version of GriefPrevention that allows players to toggle the pvp status of their claim, as well as 
remove unwanted players from claims

It adds two new commands:

**/eject**: removes all players from your claim that do not have any sort of trust.

**/claimpvp**: toggles the pvp status of the claim. This allows players to build their own areans. There 
is a 30 second buffer between the time the command is issued, to the time the status is switched.
This will hopefully prevent people from abusing it.

Players can investigate the status of a claim by clicking with a stick, as normal.
